title: The Poison Cat Theory and the Fears of the "Other"
---

When Taiwanese historian Wang Mingke conducted his fieldwork among the Qiang in northwestern Sichuan between 1994 and 2003, he often heard from locals about the folklore of _the Poison Cat_. In these oral lores, there were one or two "poison cats" in every village, primarily women suspected of black magic and poison in their nails. Some believed that when they slept at night, their souls left the bodies and manifested as animals such as cows, horses, or cats, depending on which animal fur they touched in their hidden collection, to startle villagers and cause them to fall off cliff trails. When they grew old and frail, they could only transmorph into cats and contaminate food and drinks with the poison in their fingernails. Some told stories about them flying to the banquets of poison cats to revel, gamble, and feast on human flesh, usually of children and husbands of those who lost in the gambling since most suspected poison cats were women.

Wang's research interest in discovering social realities underneath social representations led to the development of the Poison Cat Theory. According to his book _毒藥貓理論： 恐懼與暴力的社會根源_[^2], there were distinct boundaries in Qiang communities when it came to resources such as grazing land, a result of rivalry amongst them living in isolated mountainous areas. The Qiang inhabited an area between upstream Tibet and downstream regions of Han Chinese. However, for a long time, they did not identify as an ethnic group but rather Rrmea ("us" in Qiangic), a group consisting of several villages. This concept was somewhat relative: for one person, Rrmea was people in the same village/nearby villages. Anyone from upstream, who might identify as Rrmea, was considered violent Manzi (barbarian), and anyone from downstream was considered cunning Han people.

As migration was not common in Qiang communities, most people who moved to Rrmea village were women who arrived after marrying the locals. In this social context, women who crossed the social and geographical boundaries were considered dangerous and poisonous as a result of othering and hostility towards the outside of Rrmea[^3]. They were also suspected of colluding with the outside enemies, as the stories of poison cat banquet go.

Wang argues that women in patriarchal societies like Qiang are generally marginalised and excluded from power structures to different extents. They were considered neither insiders nor outsiders to men and thus vulnerable to collective mistrust and blame when the communities were confronted with stress and conflicts. Wang expands on this as a theory to examine the social roots of fear and violence toward the unclassifiable people with a marginal status in human society. Through this lens, he analysed nationalism in Germany in the 18th and 19th centuries, religious conflict in Ayodhya, India, in 1992, and the 228 incident in Taiwan in his book.

I came across this book through my research for an art exhibition exploring othering and inclusion. From a Chinese artist moving to Austria in the 80s to an Indonesian artist living in Australia now, the exploration of identification remains a recurring theme, and probably an even more relevant one in the post-pandemic times, where I have witnessed artists as a bonding force for a splitting world.

Back to Wang's book, what interests me most is how the imagination or fear of becoming a minority drives the mistrust and violence towards the "inner others." He wrote, and I translate: "For people who believe in white nationalism, white supremacism or Christian right, promoted and widely acknowledged values in the western societies such as liberalism, multiculturalism, feminism, acknowledgement of multigender, humanitarian aid for refugees and antiracism make them feel like 'politically incorrect' minorities (despite that the reality is probably the opposite)." One example is Anders Behring Breivik's crime of killing 69 participants of a Workers' Youth League summer camp in a mass shooting on the island of Utøya. In his text entitled _2083: A European Declaration of Independence_, it is clear that he worries about a "Muslim takeover" of Norway and blames western intellectuals from the Frankfurt school or labor party, which can be seen as the poison cats inside, for collusion with the Muslims, the "outside evil". The same can be witnessed in the racial hatred towards Chinese Americans in the U.S. due to mistrust and animosity towards China. Wang also argues that, compared to the large-scale violence historians recorded, micro-level aggression inflicted by the same perpetrators on their closed communities might be greater collectively and should not be overlooked.

In the Qiang community, an idiom went, "There is no village without poison cats," for poison cats ward off even greater evil from outside. Wang sees this as a vague understanding that the concept of poison cats was constructed to unite a community. However, unfortunately, it is being utilised by business or political groups for their gains, e.g., Donald Trump's campaign promise to build a wall along the United States-Mexican border to keep out "criminals and rapists". At the same time, demagogues are exacerbated by the algorithms to feed the attention economy.

In one version of the Qiang folklore, a woman was found to be a "poison cat" by her husband and deserted as a result. She then tried to wash off her poison in rivers till she came to the ninth river when the god appeared and stopped her; otherwise, poison cats would go extinct. In fact, Qiang people very seldom inflicted violence on "poison cats". Wang never had a chance to interview a person who was suspected to be a "poison cat", because villagers would not identify one to him, worrying of harm to her and her daughters (the black magic was believed to pass on from mothers to daughters). This differentiates the poison cats phenomenon from the historical witch hunting in the west, and the agency in poison cats to fight back also slightly separates themselves from scapegoats. Wang sees it as the wisdom of inclusivity of heterogeny and heterodoxy. Similarly, john a. powell states, "No matter how homogenous a society may appear along one dimension of difference, it will always contain a multitude of possible diversities along other dimensions of human difference"[^4]. The attempts to purify communities to solve conflicts often ironically lead to more tension inside and hostility outside.

The author Wang Mingke recently replied to my inquiry on translation, explaining that the book is currently being translated into Korean and Japanese, but not in English. Readers can find the book in Chinese in paperback and on Google books.
